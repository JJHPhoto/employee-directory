## Workflow

- delete first due to build errors; unexpected token ' ' bundle.js
- filters picked: last name, country. maybe registered "date".
- didn't push to github pages because....
- passed in two arrays because of "filter." A study group friend explained it to me how if you don't, you can't "go back" once you start to filter.
- issues with filter/sort. talked to study group member and he made me realize what i needed to do.
- deconstructing.
- table columns not right.
